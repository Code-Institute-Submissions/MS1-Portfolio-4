## Overview

The idea of this project was to create a website of an industrial Designer based on Milan. The site shows the designer's portfolio along with information about him, and a contact form. 

## UX

###  Strategy

The Design was minimalistic, small letters and grey colours, this was done with the the idea of making the images stand out from the background.

###  Scope

My idea was that the landing page showed a first glance of the designer’s work, simple and easy to find each project and be able to access them through a link that appears over the text when you hover over the images.

### User Stories

As a potential client I would like to go to the website and easily find the work of the Designer and browse through it, been able to find information regarding his education and Awards, and finally a way of contacting him.
